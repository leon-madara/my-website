Detailed Description of the Header Animation

The animation depicts a bottom navigation bar with a smooth, organic movement that shifts the highlighted (active) icon between positions. The bar has three icons: Home, Fire, and Settings.

1. Layout Structure

A long, rounded navigation bar sits horizontally.

Each icon is equally spaced within the bar.

The bar has a glossy black background.

Icons are simple, clean white line icons, except the active one which appears yellow/gold.

2. Active Icon Behavior

The animation highlights whichever icon is selected by placing it inside a circular raised bubble, creating a “spotlight” effect.

Feature Details:

The active icon is centered inside a perfect circle that sits deeper into the navbar.

The circle is slightly elevated visually, making it appear like a floating button.

The active icon’s circle has a white center and a black outer stroke blending into the navbar.

3. Morphing Background Shape

The bar has a wave-like indentation that follows the active icon.

How it moves:

When the user switches tabs, the curved notch slides horizontally across the bar.

The notch resembles a soft "U-shaped" dip carved into the navbar.

The depth of the dip matches the diameter of the icon’s circular container, forming a perfect cradle.

As the notch moves, it morphs smoothly with elastic-like easing (no sharp corners or jumps).

This creates the illusion that
“the navbar material is soft and deforms around the active icon.”

4. Transition Animation Between Icons
When switching icons:

The notch begins moving toward the next icon with a fluid liquid-like stretch.

The circular bubble containing the active icon slides along with it.

The previously active icon returns to a flat position in the bar.

The newly selected icon:

Rises slightly as the notch arrives,

Becomes highlighted in yellow/gold,

Sits perfectly within the new dip.

Motion characteristics:

Smooth bezier easing (slow start → fast middle → smooth stop).

No abrupt movements.

A feeling of soft elasticity, similar to iOS-style micro-interactions.

The circular button does not jump; it glides.

5. Overall Visual Impression

The animation feels:

Modern

Smooth and responsive

Playful

Minimalistic

It mimics the behavior of a dynamic floating tab selector where the active button appears to “sink” into the navbar material while the rest stay flat.
