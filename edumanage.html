                    Kenyan secondary schools implementing the Competency-Based Curriculum face an unprecedented scheduling crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rollout of CBC, while pedagogically innovative, has introduced significant operational challenges. My research — analyzing official KICD and TSC documentation and interviewing school administrators — revealed a system under strain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every term, administrators spend 2-3 weeks hunched over spreadsheets, manually constructing timetables. The process is exhausting, error-prone, and ultimately futile: 15-20% of the resulting schedules contain conflicts that require yet more weeks of revision. Teachers are overworked or underutilized. Students don't get their preferred electives. Specialized labs sit empty while classes overflow in regular rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The human cost is real. Administrators describe the timetabling period as "the most stressful weeks of the term." Teachers worry about TSC compliance violations that could affect their careers. Students feel the system is unfair when they can't study the subjects they chose.

                    This isn't just "difficult scheduling." It's an NP-hard constraint satisfaction problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CBC's flexible subject choices create a combinatorial explosion. Consider: a cohort of 270 students, each choosing from a variety of elective subjects. The number of unique subject combinations exceeds 810. Each combination creates constraints that ripple through the entire system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student A chooses Visual Arts, German, and Computer Science. Student B chooses Music, French, and Business Studies. These choices must be grouped into viable lesson blocks. But the Visual Arts teacher is only available on Monday and Wednesday mornings. The computer lab is shared with Form 2. German conflicts with the only time slot where the science lab is free for Student A's required Chemistry practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now multiply this by 270 students, 24 teachers, 15 rooms, and 40 periods per week. The search space is astronomical. Brute force is impossible. Even sophisticated algorithms struggle.

                    And then there's TSC. The Teachers Service Commission doesn't offer suggestions — they impose regulations with zero tolerance:

                    <h3>Hard Constraints (Must Satisfy — No Exceptions)</h3>

                        <li>No teacher can be in two places at once</li>

                        <li>Maximum 6 periods per teacher per day</li>
                        <li>No student can have overlapping classes</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Soft Constraints (Optimize Where Possible)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Core subjects (Math, English, Sciences) in morning slots when concentration is highest</li>
                        <li>Balanced workload distribution across teachers</li>
                        <li>Maximize student elective satisfaction</li>
                        <li>Efficient utilization of specialized rooms (labs, computer rooms)</li>

                <p>
                    A schedule that violates even one hard constraint is invalid. A schedule that ignores soft constraints is technically valid but practically unusable — teachers burn out, students underperform, resources are wasted.

                        <h3>Why Constraint Satisfaction over Genetic Algorithms?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Genetic algorithms are popular for scheduling problems. They're elegant, they sound impressive, and they often produce "good enough" solutions. But "good enough" isn't acceptable when TSC compliance is on the line.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Genetic algorithms optimize toward a solution — they don't guarantee constraint satisfaction. A timetable that's 99% compliant is still a timetable that gets a school in trouble with TSC.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Constraint Satisfaction Programming (CSP) with intelligent backtracking guarantees that every generated timetable satisfies all hard constraints. It's slower to develop, harder to optimize, but it produces schedules that are 100% valid every time.

                        <h3>Why FastAPI over Django?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Django is the obvious choice for Python web applications. It's mature, well-documented, and has a massive ecosystem. But Django is synchronous by default.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The timetable generation algorithm runs for 45 seconds. In a synchronous framework, that means the entire server is blocked for 45 seconds. No other requests can be processed. The UI freezes. Users think the system crashed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FastAPI's native async support lets the algorithm run as a background task. The UI remains responsive. Users see real-time progress updates. The server can handle multiple generation requests simultaneously. This isn't a nice-to-have — it's essential for a usable product.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why PostgreSQL with JSONB?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A generated timetable is a deeply nested data structure. Each day contains periods. Each period contains classes. Each class contains a teacher, room, subject, and student list. Normalizing this into relational tables would require dozens of joins for every query.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PostgreSQL's JSONB columns let us store the complete timetable as a single document while maintaining relational integrity for the entities (students, teachers, subjects, rooms). We get the query flexibility of a document database with the ACID guarantees of PostgreSQL.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This hybrid approach means fast reads for displaying timetables and reliable writes for the generation process.

                        <h3>Why React + TypeScript?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The timetable grid is complex UI. It needs to display 40 periods across 5 days, filterable by class, teacher, or room. Users need to see conflicts highlighted, drag-and-drop for manual adjustments, and real-time updates during generation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            React's component model handles this complexity well. But the real win is TypeScript. The API returns deeply nested JSON. The frontend expects specific shapes. Without type checking, mismatches between API responses and frontend expectations cause silent failures that are nightmare to debug.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TypeScript caught 15+ bugs during development — type mismatches that would have been runtime errors in production. The setup cost paid for itself within the first week.

The timetable is presented in a clear grid format with options to view by class, teacher, or room. A step-by-step wizard guides administrators through CSV upload, constraint configuration, and generation. Real-time progress indicators show algorithm status during the 45-second generation process.

                    <p>
                        <strong>99.9% time reduction</strong> isn't just a metric — it's 6-9 weeks of administrative time freed up annually. That's time administrators can spend on actual education instead of wrestling with spreadsheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>100% TSC compliance</strong> means teachers get fair workloads. No one is overloaded with 30 periods while a colleague has 18. No one risks regulatory sanctions because of a scheduling error.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>&lt;1% conflict rate</strong> eliminates the revision cycle. The first generated timetable is usable. No more weeks of "fixing" a broken schedule.

                            <strong>Elective satisfaction at 85%, not 95%.</strong> When TSC compliance conflicts with student preference, the algorithm prioritizes compliance. This is the right trade-off, but it means some students don't get their first-choice electives. Improving this requires more sophisticated optimization that I'm still developing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Single-school deployment.</strong> The system works for one school at a time. Multi-tenant architecture for district-wide deployment is designed but not implemented. This limits scalability for now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>No mobile interface.</strong> Administrators use desktop computers for this workflow, so I prioritized desktop UX. A mobile companion app for teachers to view their schedules would be valuable but isn't built yet.

                        <p>
                            I spent the first two weeks not writing code. I read KICD curriculum documents. I studied TSC regulations. I interviewed three school administrators about their current processes. I sat with a deputy principal while she manually built a timetable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That investment shaped every technical decision. I understood why TSC compliance wasn't negotiable. I learned that "elective clustering" was the real bottleneck, not the scheduling itself. I discovered that schools had tried generic scheduling software before — and abandoned it because it didn't understand Kenyan education.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without that domain knowledge, I would have built the wrong thing faster.

                        <p>
                            The 60-second target wasn't arbitrary. It came from user research: administrators said they'd wait up to a minute for a result, but anything longer felt "broken." That constraint drove the entire algorithm design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every optimization decision — constraint pruning, intelligent backtracking, NumPy vectorization — was made to hit that target. I profiled constantly. I benchmarked against real school data. When the algorithm hit 3 minutes, I didn't ship it and promise to "optimize later." I went back and rewrote the constraint checking logic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Premature optimization is bad. But ignoring performance until the end is worse. For compute-intensive applications, performance is a feature requirement, not a polish item.

                            TSC rules aren't suggestions. Schools that violate them face real consequences. This single fact determined the choice of Constraint Satisfaction over Genetic Algorithms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It also shaped the validation layer. Every generated timetable is checked against TSC rules before being saved. The UI shows compliance status prominently. Export formats include compliance certificates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lesson: compliance requirements should be gathered before writing code, not discovered during testing. They're not edge cases — they're core requirements that shape the entire system.

                            Garbage in, garbage out. The CSV validation layer ended up catching more issues than the algorithm itself.

                            Schools had inconsistent teacher names ("Mr. Ochieng" vs "Ochieng, J." vs "James Ochieng"). Duplicate student entries. Room capacities that didn't match reality. Subject codes that varied between departments.
                        </p>

                            I built comprehensive validation with clear error messages. "Row 47: Teacher 'Mr. Ochieng' not found. Did you mean 'Ochieng, James'?" This saved weeks of debugging and made the system actually usable by non-technical administrators.

                        <p>
                            This project required understanding how the frontend, backend, database, and algorithm all interact. A change in the algorithm's output format affected the API schema, which affected the TypeScript types, which affected the UI components.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being able to work across the entire stack meant I could make these changes coherently. I didn't have to wait for "the backend team" to update the API or "the frontend team" to adjust the UI. I could see the whole system and make decisions that optimized for the user experience, not for layer boundaries.

                            Specialization has its place. But for complex applications where everything is connected, full-stack capability isn't a nice-to-have — it's essential.
